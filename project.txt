	Gameplay
================

	1. Round 1 begins.

	2. Both players draw a card.

	3. Three randomly selected words appear in the word pool.

	4. Player 1 may play his or her card if desired, and if the effect described on the card is applicable.

	5. Player 1 creates a word on the board using any letters from the word pool. The word must:

		- Consist of at least two letters

		- Not have any sequence of three or more letters in common with any word from the word pool

		- Be in the center of the board, over the home icon

	6. Player 1 is awarded points for the word, and his or her turn is complete.

	7. Player 2 may play his or her card if desired, and if the effect described on the card is applicable.

	8. Player 2 creates a word on the board, adhering to the following:

		- If player 1 created a word of 9 or fewer letters, player 2 creates a word from the remaining letters in the word pool.

		- If player 1 created a word of 10 or more letters, that word becomes the effective word pool for player 2, and he or she
		  must create a word from only those letters. Player 2 is only awarded points for the letters used in his or her new word.
		  No points are awarded for any remaining letters that happen to form valid words.

		- In either case, the new word must:

			+ Consist of at least two letters

			+ Not have any sequence of three or more letters in common with any word from the word pool

	9. Round 2 begins. The players continue as described above, alternating who plays first each round.

	10. The first player to score 500 or more points is the winner.

		Scoring methods:

			- Various squares on the board contain 2x, 3x, or 4x multipliers. These squares multiply the values of the letters placed directly upon them.

			- Various squares on the board contain DOUBLE-WORD or TRIPLE-WORD multipliers. These squares double or triple the sum of the values of all letters in the word.




===================
	Development
===================

	- This is a TDD project.

	- If you decide not to use JSX after all, here's an example of what to do:

		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29286899/how-do-i-make-components-in-react-native-without-using-jsx

		(remember that you should try to call createFactory() only once (globally) for each component type)

	- The structure of React Native apps does not lend itself to controllers or models. As a result:

	    + A single Navigator component will route directly to view components

	        > If a view component needs to make an AJAX request:

	            - It will do so in the method prescribed by the documentation: componentDidMount()

	            - The render() method will render a WaitingView component

	            - When the request is complete, the data will be passed to setState(), which will cause the view to render again

	                + In other words state, not props, will be used for view re-rendering

	- The iOS app will be developed in React Native.

	- The web app will be developed in React JS.

	- The promotional and instructional YouTube videos will be produced.

	- The Android app will be developed in React Native.


=========================
	Code Organization
=========================

	- The root of the project is ~/code/WordsFromWords/

		+ To run your app on iOS:
		    Open /Users/rob/code/WordsFromWords/ios/WordsFromWords.xcodeproj in Xcode
		    Hit the Run button

		+ To run your app on Android:
		    Have an Android emulator running (quickest way to get started), or a device connected
		    cd /Users/rob/code/WordsFromWords
		    react-native run-android

	- The different platforms are organized in the root as follows:

		android/
		ios/
		web/

	- Modules shared by all platforms (such as models) are located in ~/code/WordsFromWords/shared/
