When the app is first released and usage is low, the node, redis, and postgres servers will all run on the same box:


Internet
   ||
   ||
   \/
  node
   ||
   ||
   \/
 redis
   ||
   ||
   \/
postgres


If usage increases (fingers crossed), then each service in the chain can moved to its own instance.

Things to think about with redis and login requests:

    - How long should the uuid/token live in the cache?
    
    -
