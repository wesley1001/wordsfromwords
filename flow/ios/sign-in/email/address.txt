// What happens in these scenarios?
//
//     1. User says 'Yes' to creating an account, closes the app before entering the code, then opens the app and tries again
//
//     2. Malicious user says 'Yes' to creating an account with someone else's email address



When the user taps the 'Sign in with Email' button on the LoginChoicesView:

    LoginChoicesModel navigates (via push) to EmailAddressView

    EmailAddressView renders:

        - A gorgeous background of some kind (same as LoadingView?)

        - A single input (with 'placeholder' set to 'Email Address' and 'keyboardType' set to 'email-address')

        - A 'Next >' button

    User action occurs:

        if (the user types an email address) {

            EmailAddressView saves it (onChangeText) to EmailLoginModel

        }

        if (the user taps the 'Next >' button) {

            EmailAddressView notifies EmailLoginModel

            EmailLoginModel checks email:

                if (email doesn't contain an '@' symbol) {

                    EmailLoginModel calls back to EmailAddressView with {reason: 'invalid'}

                    EmailAddressView displays an alert:

                        'Uh, yeah...'

                        'We're gonna need you to go ahead and enter a valid email address. Mmmkay?'

                        [OK]

                } else {

                    EmailLoginModel POSTs email to /api/email/exists

                    /api/email/exists looks up the uuid WHERE email = email

                    if (uuid exists) {

                        /api/email/exists returns a 200 response (OK) with {exists: true}

                        EmailLoginModel navigates (via push) to EmailPasswordView

                        ---> flow/ios/sign-in/email/password.txt

                    } else {

                        /api/email/exists returns a 200 response (OK) with {exists: false}

                        EmailLoginModel calls back to EmailAddressView with {reason: 'new'}

                        EmailAddressView displays an alert:

                            'Welcome!'

                            "Looks like you're a new player. Shall we create an account for ${email}?"

                            [Yes] [No]

                        if (user taps [Yes]) {

                            EmailAddressView notifies EmailLoginModel

                            EmailLoginModel POSTs the email to /api/email/create

                            /api/email/create looks up the uuid WHERE email = email

                            if (uuid === null) {

                                /api/email/create does the following:

                                    generates a new uuid

                                    generates a 6-digit verify_code

                                    INSERTs the uuid, email, and verify_code

                                    sends an email with the verify_code to email

                                    returns a 200 response (OK) with {uuid: uuid}

                                    EmailLoginModel saves uuid to itself

                                    EmailLoginModel navigates (via push) to EmailSetPasswordView

                                    ---> flow/ios/sign-in/email/set-password.txt

                            } else {

                                /api/email/create returns a 400 response (Bad Request)

                            }

                        }

                    }

                }

        }
